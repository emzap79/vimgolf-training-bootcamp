# About

Created a little script which lets you practice your favourite challenges
offline.  After saving your session `ZZ`, it'll prompt the amount of keysrokes
and leave you with some further options to choose, such as `change challenge`,
`rm challenge` or `quit`.

# Add Challenges

It's simple enough, I give you a gothrough anyways.

1. clone this repository to wherever you like:

````git clone git@github.com:emzap79/vimgolf.git .````

2. `cd` into it,

3. copy text from vimgolf.com and save it as *chall_< name_of_chall >.vg* into
   directory. Be sure to copy the entire challenge, including both, start file
   as well as the challenges final version (as long as it contains
   "start file" and "view diff", you're save!).

4. Make this script executable `chmod +x ./vimGolf.sh`, then ...

5. start playing and save some keystrokes :bowtie:
